# Machine-Learning-Capstone-Project--Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Project Title :Credit Card Fraud Detection
# Problem Statement:
With the increasing prevalence of online transactions, ensuring the security of credit card
transactions is very important. The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine
learning model capable of accurately detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time.
Utilizing a dataset containing transaction details such as transaction amount, merchant
category, cardholder information, transaction location, the aim is to build a predictive model
that can effectively differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. By employing
advanced machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques, the goal is to create
a system that enhances fraud detection capabilities, thereby minimizing financial losses for both
cardholders and financial institutions while maintaining a low false positive rate. Ultimately, this
project seeks to contribute to the development of proactive measures for securing credit card
transactions and safeguarding the financial interests of stakeholders in the digital economy.
